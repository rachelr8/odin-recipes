    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups (3 sticks; 345g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>8 ounce (226g) block full-fat cream cheese, softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>2 and 1/2 cups (500g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (80g) sour cream, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>6 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>3 cups (354g) cake flou</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>optional for serving: whipped cream and berries</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325&#176;F. Generously grease a 10-12 cup Bundt pan with butter or nonstick spray.</li>
        <li>Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter on high speed 
            until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a 
            rubber spatula. Add the cream cheese and beat on high speed until completely smooth and combined, about 1 
            minute. Add the sugar and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute, then add the sour cream 
            and vanilla and beat on high speed until combined and creamy. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of 
            the bowl with a rubber spatula.</li>
        <li>Pour/spoon batter evenly into prepared pan. Bang the pan on the counter once or twice to bring up any 
            air bubbles. Bake for 75-95 minutes. Loosely tent the baking cake with aluminum foil halfway through bake 
            time to ensure the surface does not over-brown. The key to pound cake is a slow and low bake time. Use a 
            toothpick to test for doneness. Once it comes out completely clean, the pound cake is done. This is a large 
            heavy cake so donâ€™t be alarmed if it takes longer in your oven. If it needs longer, bake longer.</li>
        <li>Remove cake from the oven and allow to cool for 2 hours inside the pan. Then invert the slightly 
            cooled pound cake onto a wire rack or serving dish. Allow to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve with optional toppings.</li>
        <li>Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
    </ol>
